This is an implementation of one of those simple memory games. Just click on
two matching cards until the board is cleared.

To build:
This was written in Eclipse, so you can open this in that and compile it. Or
from the command line, just go into the memoryGame package directory and run
'javac *.java'. Run the createjar.bat file to create an executable jar file,
to run the command manually from the command prompt.

To run:
java -jar MemoryGame.jar
or open the game.html in a web browser and run the applet version.
